AI was used to generate space and elements for the skybox images. 
The images were then upscaled and edited to fix seams, artifacts, stretch, and vortex elements. 
Only generic words were used in prompts, no media titles or artist names.

Images have been converted from single panorama to 6 sided cube maps. 
Images have been completely transformed from their original promt output.
